<h3 id="_problem_buying_a_computer">1.1. Problem: Buying a computer</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We begin almost every chapter of this book with a motivating problem.
Why? Sometimes it helps to see how tools can be applied in order to see
why they’re useful. As we move through each chapter, we cover background
concepts needed to solve the problem in the <strong>Concepts</strong> section, the
specific technical details (usually in the form of Java syntax) required
in the <strong>Syntax</strong> section, and eventually the solution to
the problem in the <strong>Solution</strong> sections. If you’re not interested in the
problem, that’s fine! Feel free to skip ahead to <a href="index.html#_concepts_hardware_and_software">Section 1.2</a> on hardware and software
or to <a href="index.html#_syntax_data_representation">Section 1.3</a> on data representation, especially if you
already have some programming experience. Then, if you’d like to see
another detailed example, the solution to this problem is available in <a href="index.html#_solution_buying_a_computer">Section 1.4</a> as a reference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’ll start with a problem that’s not about programming and may be
familiar to you. Imagine you’re just about to start college and need a
computer. Should you buy a Mac or PC? What kind of computer is going to
run programs faster? Do some kinds of computers crash more than others?
Which features are worth paying more for? Why are there so many
buzzwords and so much impenetrable jargon associated with buying a
computer?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When many people hear “computer science,” these are often the first
questions that come to mind. Most of this book is about programming
computers in a language called Java and <strong>not</strong> about the computers
themselves. We try to present all material so that almost any kind
of computer can be used when programming the problems and examples.
Nevertheless, both the hardware that makes up your computer and the
other software running on it affect the way the programs you write work.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_concepts_hardware_and_software">1.2. Concepts: Hardware and software</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computers are ubiquitous. We see them nearly everywhere. They are found
in most homes, shops, cars, aircraft, phones, and inside many other
devices. Sometimes they are obvious, like a laptop sitting on a desk,
but most computers are hidden inside other devices such as a watch or a
flat-panel television. Computers can be complex or relatively simple
machines. Despite their diversity, we can think of all computers in
terms of their <em>hardware</em> and the <em>software</em> that runs on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_hardware">1.2.1. Hardware</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hardware consists of the physical components that make up a computer but
not the programs or data stored on it. Hardware components can be seen
and touched, if you are willing to open the computer case. One way to
organize hardware is to break it down into three categories: the
processor, the memory, and input and output (I/O) devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This view of a computer is a simplified version of what is called the
von Neumann architecture or a stored-program computer. It’s a good (but
imperfect) model of most modern computers. In this model, a program (a
list of instructions) is stored in memory. The processor loads the
program and performs the instructions, some of which require the
processor to do a lot of number crunching. Sometimes the processor reads
data out of memory or writes new data into it. Periodically, the
processor may send output to one of the output devices or receive input
from one of the input devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, the processor thinks, the memory stores, and the I/O
devices talk to the outside world. The processor sits between the
memory and the I/O devices. Let’s examine these categories further.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The processor, or central processing unit (CPU), is the “brain” of a
computer. It fetches instructions, decodes them, and executes them. It
may send data to or from memory or I/O devices. The CPU on virtually all
modern computers is a <em>microprocessor</em>, meaning that all the computation
is done by an integrated circuit fabricated out of silicon. What
are the important features of CPUs? How do we measure their speed and
power?</p>

Frequency
</td>
<td class="hdlist2">
<p>The speed of a CPU (and indeed a computer as a whole) is often quoted
in gigahertz (GHz). Hertz (Hz) is a measurement of frequency. If
something happens once per second, it has a frequency of exactly 1 Hz.
Perhaps the second hand on your watch moves with a frequency of 1 Hz.
In North America, the current in electrical outlets alternates with a
frequency of approximately 60 Hz. Sound can also be measured by
frequency. The lowest-pitched sound the human ear can hear is around
20 Hz. The highest-pitched sound is around 20,000 Hz. Such a sound
pulses against your eardrum 20,000 times per second. That sounds like
a lot, but many modern computers operate at a frequency of 1 to 4
gigahertz. The prefix “giga” means “billion.” So, we’re talking
about computers doing <strong>something</strong> more than a billion (1,000,000,000)
times per second.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But <strong>what</strong> are they doing? This frequency is the <em>clock rate</em>, which
marks how often a regular electrical signal passes through the CPU. On
each tick, the CPU does some computation. How much? It depends. On
some systems, simple instructions (like adding two numbers) can be
computed in a single clock cycle. Other instructions can take ten or
more clock cycles. Different processor designs can take different
numbers of cycles to execute the same instructions. Instructions are
also <em>pipelined</em>, meaning that one instruction is being executed while
another one is being fetched from memory or decoded. Different processors can have
different ways of optimizing this process. Because of these
differences, the frequency of a processor as measured in gigahertz is
not an accurate way to compare the effective speed of one processor to
another, unless the two processors are very closely related. Even
though it doesn’t really make sense, clock rate is commonly advertised
as the speed of a computer.</p>

Word size
</td>
<td class="hdlist2">
<p>Perhaps you have heard of a 32-bit or 64-bit computer. As we discuss
in the subsection about memory, a bit is a 0 or a 1, the smallest
amount of information you can record. Most new laptop and desktop
computers are 64-bit machines, meaning that they operate on 64 bits at
a time and can use 64-bit values as memory addresses. The instructions
that they execute often perform calculations on 64-bit quantities,
i.e., numbers made up of 64 0s and 1s.
The size of data that a computer can operate on with a
single instruction is known as its <em>word size</em>.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In day-to-day operations, word size is not important to most users.
Certain programs that interact directly with the hardware, such as the
operating system, may be affected by the word size. For example, most
modern 32-bit operating systems are designed to run on a 64-bit
processor, but most 64-bit operating systems do not run on a 32-bit
processor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Programs often run faster on machines with a larger word size, but
they typically take up more memory. A 32-bit processor (or operating
system) cannot use more than 4 gigabytes (defined below) of memory.
Thus, a 64-bit computer is needed to take advantage of the larger
amounts of memory that are now available.</p>

Cache
</td>
<td class="hdlist2">
<p>Human brains both perform computations and store information. A
computer CPU performs computations, but for the most part, does not
store information. The CPU cache is the exception. Most modern CPUs
have a small, very fast section of memory built right onto the chip.
By guessing what information the CPU is going to use next, it
can pre-load it into the cache and avoid waiting around for the slower
regular memory.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over time, caches have become more complicated and often have multiple
levels. The first level is very small but incredibly fast. The second
level is larger and slower. And so on. It would be preferable to have
a large, first-level cache, but fast memory is expensive memory. Each
level is larger, slower, and cheaper than the last.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cache size is not a heavily advertised CPU feature, but it makes a
huge difference in performance. A processor with a larger cache can
often outperform a processor that’s faster in terms of clock rate.</p>

<p>Most laptops and desktops available today have <em>multicore</em> processors.
These processors contain two, four, six, or even more cores. Each core
is a processor capable of independently executing instructions, and
they can all communicate with the same memory.</p>

<h5 id="_memory">Memory</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Memory is where all the programs and data on a computer are stored. The
memory in a computer is usually not a single piece of hardware. Instead,
the storage requirements of a computer are met by many different
technologies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the top of the pyramid of memory is primary storage, memory that the
CPU can access and control directly. On desktop and laptop computers,
primary storage usually takes the form of random access memory (RAM). It
is called random access memory because it takes the same amount of time
to access any part of RAM. Traditional RAM is volatile, meaning that its
contents are lost when it’s unpowered. All programs and data must be
loaded into RAM to be used by the CPU.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After primary storage comes secondary storage. The realm of secondary
storage is dominated by hard drives that store data on spinning magnetic platters
though flash technology is beginning to replace them. Optical
drives (such as CD, DVD, and Blu-ray) and the now virtually obsolete
floppy drives also fall into the category of secondary
storage. Secondary storage is slower than primary storage, but
it is non-volatile. Some forms of secondary storage such as CD-ROM and
DVD-ROM are read only, but most are capable of reading and writing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we can compare these kinds of storage effectively, we need to
have a system for measuring how much they store. In modern digital
computers, all data is stored as a sequence of 0s and 1s. In memory, the
space that can hold either a single 0 or a single 1 is called a <em>bit</em>,
which is short for “binary digit.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A bit is a tiny amount of information. For organizational purposes, we
call a sequence of eight bits a <em>byte</em>. The word size of a CPU is two or
more bytes, but memory capacity is usually listed in bytes not words.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

<div class="title">Figure 1.2 Shown here is a word containing four bytes, or 32 bits. Computer scientists often number items starting at zero, as we discuss in <a href="chap6.html">Chapter 6</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both primary and secondary storage capacities have become so large that
it is inconvenient to describe them in bytes. Computer scientists have
borrowed prefixes from physical scientists to create suitable units.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Common units for measuring memory are bytes, kilobytes, megabytes,
gigabytes, and terabytes. Each unit is 1,024 times the size of the
previous unit. You may have noticed that 2<sup>10</sup> (1,024) is almost the
same as 10<sup>3</sup> (1,000). Sometimes it’s not clear which
value is meant. Disk drive manufacturers always use powers of 10 when
they quote the size of their disks. Thus, a 1 TB hard disk might hold
10<sup>12</sup> (1,000,000,000,000) bytes, not
2<sup>40</sup> (1,099,511,627,776) bytes. Standards organizations
have advocated that the terms kibibyte (KiB), mebibyte (MiB), gibibyte
(GiB), and tebibyte (TiB) be used to refer to the units based on powers
of 2 while the traditional names be used to refer only to the units
based on powers of 10, but the new terms have not yet become popular.</p>

Operating Systems

<td class="hdlist2">
<p>The <em>operating system</em> (OS) is the software that manages the
interaction between the hardware and the rest of the software.
Programs called <em>drivers</em> are added to the OS for each hardware
device. For example, when an application wants to print a document, it
communicates with the printer via a printer driver that’s customized
for the specific printer, the OS, and the computer hardware. The OS
also schedules, runs, and manages memory for all other programs. The
three most common OSes for desktop machines are Microsoft Windows,
Apple macOS, and Linux. At the present time, all three run on similar hardware
based on the Intel x86 and x64 architectures.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Microsoft does not sell desktop computers, but many desktop and laptop
computers come bundled with Windows. For individuals and businesses
who assemble their own computer hardware, it’s also possible to
purchase Windows separately. In contrast, almost all computers
running macOS are sold by Apple, and macOS is usually bundled with the computer.
Linux is <em>open-source software</em>, meaning that all the source code used
to create it is freely available. In spite of Linux being free, many
consumers prefer Windows or macOS because of ease of use,
compatibility with specific software, and technical support. Many
consumers are also unaware that hardware can be purchased separately
from an OS or that Linux is a free alternative to the other two.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other computers have OSes as well. Many kinds of
mobile telephones use the Google Android OS. The Apple iPad and iPhone
use the competing Apple iOS. Phones, microwave ovens, automobiles, and
countless other devices have computers in them that use some kind of
embedded OS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider two applications running on a mobile phone with a single core
CPU. One application is a web browser and the other is a music player.
The user may start listening to music and then start the browser. In
order to function, both applications need to access the CPU at the
same time. Since the CPU only has a single core, it can execute only
one instruction at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rather than forcing the user to finish listening to the song before
using the web browser, the OS switches the CPU between the two
applications very quickly. This switching allows the user to continue
browsing while the music plays in the background. The user perceives
an illusion that both applications are using the CPU at the same time.</p>

<h4 id="_compilers_and_interpreters">1.3.1. Compilers and interpreters</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book is primarily about solving problems with computer programs.
From now on, we only mention hardware when it has an impact on
programming. The first step to writing a computer program is deciding
what language to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most humans communicate via natural languages such as Chinese, English,
French, Russian, or Tamil. However, computers are poor at understanding
natural languages. As a compromise, programmers write programs
(instructions for a computer to follow) in a language more similar to a
natural language than it is to the language understood by the CPU. These
languages are called <em>high-level languages</em>, because they are closer to
natural language (the highest level) than they are to <em>machine language</em>
(the lowest level). We may also refer to machine language as <em>machine
code</em> or <em>native code</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thousands of programming languages have been created over the years, but
some of the most popular high-level languages of all time include
Fortran, Cobol, Visual Basic, C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript (which is almost
entirely unrelated to Java) and C#.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we mentioned in the previous section, a compiler is a program that
translates one language into another. In many cases, a compiler
translates a high-level language into a low-level language that the CPU
can understand and execute. Because all the work is done ahead of time,
this kind of compilation is known as static or ahead-of-time
compilation. In other cases, the output of the compiler is an
intermediate language that’s easier for the computer to understand than
the high-level language but still takes some translation before the
computer can follow the instructions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An <em>interpreter</em> is a program with many similarities to a compiler. However, an
interpreter takes code in one language as input and, on the fly, runs
each instruction on the CPU as it translates it. Interpreters generally
execute code more slowly than if it had been translated to machine
language before execution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that both compilers and interpreters are normal programs. They are
usually written in high-level languages and compiled into machine
language before execution. This raises a philosophical question: If you
need a compiler to create a program, where did the first compiler come
from?</p>

<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 1.1 Java compilation</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java is the popular high-level programming language we focus on in
this book. The standard way to run a Java program has an extra step that
many compiled languages do not. Most compilers for Java, though not all,
translate a program written in Java to an intermediate language known as
<em>bytecode</em>. This intermediate version of the high-level program is used
as input for another program called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Most
popular JVMs translate the bytecode into machine code that is executed
directly by the CPU. This conversion from bytecode into machine code is
done with a just-in-time (JIT) compiler. It’s called “just-in-time”
because sections of bytecode are not compiled until the moment they’re
needed. Since the output is going to be used for this specific
execution of the program, the JIT can do optimizations to make the final
machine code run particularly well in the current environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why does Java use the intermediate step of bytecode? One of Java’s
design goals is to be platform independent, meaning that it can be
executed on any kind of computer. This is a difficult goal because every
combination of OS and CPU will need different low-level instructions.
Java attacks the problem by keeping its bytecode platform independent.
You can compile a program into bytecode on a Windows machine and then
run the bytecode on a JVM in a macOS environment. Part of the work is
platform independent, and part is not. Each JVM must be tailored to the
combination of OS and hardware that it runs on. Sun Microsystems, Inc.,
the original developer of the Java language and the JVM,
marketed this feature of the language with the slogan “Write once, run anywhere.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sun Microsystems was bought by Oracle Corporation in 2009. Oracle continues
to produce HotSpot, the standard JVM, but many other JVMs exist,
including Apache Harmony and Dalvik, the Google Android JVM.</p>

<h4 id="_numbers">1.3.2. Numbers</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All data inside of a computer is represented with numbers. Although
humans use numbers in our daily lives, the representation and
manipulation of numbers by computers function differently. In this
subsection we introduce the notions of number systems, bases, conversion
from one base to another, and arithmetic in arbitrary number systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_a_few_number_systems">A few number systems</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A number system is a way to represent numbers. It’s easy to confuse the
<em>numeral</em> that represents the <em>number</em> with the number itself. You might
think of the number ten as “10”, a numeral made of two symbols, but
the number itself is the concept of <strong>ten-ness</strong>. You could express that
quantity by holding up all your fingers, with the symbol “X”, or by
knocking ten times.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Representing ten with “10” is an example of a <em>positional number
system</em>, namely base 10. In a positional number system, the position of
the digits determines the magnitude they represent. For example, the
numeral 3,432 contains the digit 3 twice. The first time, it represents
three groups of one thousand. The second time, it represents three
groups of ten. In contrast, the Roman numeral system is an example of a number
system that is <strong>not</strong> positional.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The numeral 3,432 and possibly every other normally written number you’ve
seen is expressed in base 10 or the <em>decimal</em> system. It’s called
base 10 because, as you move from the rightmost digit leftward, the
value of each position goes up by a factor of 10. Also, in base 10, ten
is the smallest positive integer that requires two digits for
representation. Each smaller number has its own digit: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, and 9. Representing ten requires two existing digits to be
combined. Every base has the property that the number it’s named after
takes two digits to write, namely “1” and “0.” (An exception is base
1, which does not behave like the other bases and is not a normal
positional number system.)</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 1.2 Decimal numbers</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The number 723 can be written as
723 = 7 · 10<sup>2</sup> + 2 · 10<sup>1</sup> + 3 · 10<sup>0</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the rightmost digit is the ones place, which is equivalent to
10<sup>0</sup>. Be sure to start with <em>b</em><sup>0</sup> and not
<em>b</em><sup>1</sup> when considering the value of a number written in base
<em>b</em>, no matter what <em>b</em> is. The second digit
from the right is multiplied by 10<sup>1</sup>, and so on. The
product of a digit and the corresponding power of 10 tells us how much a
digit contributes to the number. In the above expansion, digit 7
contributes 700 to the number 723. Digits 2 and 3 contribute,
respectively, 20 and 3 to 723.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we move to the right, the power of 10 goes down by one, and this
pattern works even for negative powers of 10. If we expand the
fractional value 0.324, we get
0.324 = 3 · 10<sup>-1</sup> + 2 · 10<sup>-2</sup> + 4 · 10<sup>-3</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can combine the above two numbers to get
723.324 = 7 · 10<sup>2</sup> + 2 · 10<sup>1</sup> + 3 · 10<sup>0</sup> + 3 · 10<sup>-1</sup> + 2 · 10<sup>-2</sup> + 4 · 10<sup>-3</sup>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can extend these ideas to any base, checking our logic against the
familiar base 10. Suppose that a numeral consists of <em>n</em> symbols
<em>s</em><sub><em>n</em>-1</sub>, <em>s</em><sub><em>n</em>-2</sub>, …, <em>s</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>s</em><sub>0</sub>. Furthermore, suppose that this numeral
belongs to the base <em>b</em> number system. We can expand the
value of this numeral as:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><em>s</em><sub><em>n</em>-1</sub> <em>s</em><sub><em>n</em>-2</sub> … <em>s</em><sub>1</sub> <em>s</em><sub>0</sub> = <em>s</em><sub><em>n</em>-1</sub> · <em>b</em><sup><em>n</em>-1</sup> + <em>s</em><sub><em>n</em>-2</sub> · <em>b</em><sup><em>n</em>-2</sup> + … + <em>s</em><sub>1</sub> · <em>b</em><sup>1</sup> + <em>s</em><sub>0</sub> · <em>b</em><sup>0</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The leftmost symbol in the numeral is the <em>highest order digit</em> and the
rightmost symbol is the <em>lowest order digit</em>. For example, in the
decimal numeral 492, 4 is the highest order digit and 2 the lowest order
digit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fractions can be expanded in a similar manner. For example, a
fraction with <em>n</em> symbols
<em>s</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>s</em><sub>2</sub>, …, <em>s</em><sub><em>n</em>-1</sub>, <em>s</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> in a number system
with base <em>b</em> can be expanded to:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p>0.<em>s</em><sub>1</sub> <em>s</em><sub>2</sub> … <em>s</em><sub><em>n</em>-2</sub> <em>s</em><sub><em>n</em>-1</sub> = <em>s</em><sub>1</sub> · <em>b</em><sup>-1</sup> + <em>s</em><sub>2</sub> · <em>b</em><sup>-2</sup> + … + <em>s</em><sup><em>n</em>-1</sup> · <em>b</em><sup>-<em>n</em>+1</sup> + <em>s</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> · <em>b</em><sup>-<em>n</em></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As
computer scientists, we have a special interest in base 2 because that’s the base
used to express numbers inside of computers. Base 2 is also called
<em>binary</em>. The only symbols allowed to represent numbers in binary are
“0” and “1”, the binary digits or <em>bits</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the binary numeral 10011, the leftmost 1 is the highest order bit
and the rightmost 0 is the lowest order bit. By the rules of positional
number systems, the highest order bit represents
1 · 2<sup>4</sup> = 16.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 1.3 Binary numbers</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples of numbers written in binary are 100<sub>2</sub>, 111<sub>2</sub>, 10101<sub>2</sub>, and 11000001<sub>2</sub>.
Recall that the base of the binary number system is 2. Thus, we can
write a number in binary as the sum of products of powers of 2. For
example, the numeral 10011<sub>2</sub> can be expanded to:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p>10011<sub>2</sub> = 1 · 2<sup>4</sup> + 0 · 2<sup>3</sup> + 0 · 2<sup>2</sup> + 1 · 2<sup>1</sup> + 1 · 2<sup>0</sup> = 16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 19</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By expanding the number, we’ve also shown how to convert a binary
numeral into a decimal numeral. Remember that both 10011<sub>2</sub> and 19
represent the same value, namely nineteen. The conversion between bases
changes only the way the number is written. As before, the rightmost bit
is multiplied by 2<sup>0</sup> to determine its contribution to the
binary number. The bit to its left is multiplied by 2<sup>1</sup> to
determine its contribution, and so on. In this case, the leftmost 1
contributes 1 · 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 to the value.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another useful number system is <em>base 16</em>, also known as <em>hexadecimal</em>.
Hexadecimal is surprising because it requires more than the familiar 10
digits. Numerals in this system are written with 16 hexadecimal digits
that include the ten digits 0 through 9 and the six letters A, B, C, D,
E, and F. The six letters, starting from A, correspond to the values 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hexadecimal is used as a compact representation of binary. Although binary
numbers can get very long, four binary digits can be represented
with only a single hexadecimal digit.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 1.4 Hexadecimal numbers</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>39A<sub>16</sub>, 32<sub>16</sub>, and AFBC12<sub>16</sub> are examples of numbers written in hexadecimal. A
hexadecimal numeral can be expressed as the sum of products of powers of
16. For example, the hexadecimal numeral A0BF<sub>16</sub> can be expanded to:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p>A · 16<sup>3</sup> + 0 · 16<sup>2</sup> + B · 16<sup>1</sup> + F ·
16<sup>0</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To convert a hexadecimal numeral to decimal, we must substitute the
values 10 through 15 for the digits A through F. Now we can rewrite the
sum of products from above as:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p>10 · 16<sup>3</sup> + 0 · 16<sup>2</sup> + 11 · 16<sup>1</sup> + 15 · 16<sup>0</sup> = 40,960 + 0 + 176 + 15 = 41,151</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, we get A0BF<sub>16</sub> = 41,151.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The base 8 number system is also called <em>octal</em>. Like hexadecimal, octal
is used as a shorthand for binary. A numeral in octal uses the octal
digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Otherwise the same rules apply. For
example, the octal numeral 377 can be expanded to:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p>377<sub>8</sub> = 3 · 8<sup>2</sup> + 7 · 8<sup>1</sup> + 7 · 8<sup>0</sup> = 255</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may have noticed that it is not always clear which base a numeral is
written in. The digit sequence 337 is a legal numeral in octal, decimal,
and hexadecimal, but it represents different numbers in each system.
Mathematicians use a subscript to denote the base in which a numeral is
written.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, 337<sub>8</sub> = 255<sub>10</sub>, 377<sub>10</sub> = 377<sub>10</sub>,
and 377<sub>16</sub> = 887<sub>10</sub>. Base numbers are always written
in base 10. A number without a subscript is assumed to be in base 10. In
Java, there’s no way to mark subscripts, so prefixes are used. A
prefix of <code>0</code> is used for octal, no prefix is used for decimal, and a prefix
of <code>0x</code> is used for hexadecimal. A numeral cannot be marked as binary in
Java. The corresponding numerals in Java code would thus be written <code>0377</code>, <code>377</code>,
and <code>0x377</code>. Be careful not to pad numbers with zeroes in Java since they might be interpreted as base 8! Remember that
the value <code>056</code> is <strong>not</strong> the same as the value <code>56</code> in Java.</p>

<p>There are at least two different ways to convert a decimal numeral to
binary. One way is to write the decimal number as a sum of powers of two
as in the following conversion of the number 23.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p>23 = 16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 1 · 2<sup>4</sup> + 0 · 2<sup>3</sup> + 1 · 2<sup>2</sup> + 1 · 2<sup>1</sup> + 1 · 2<sup>0</sup> = 10111<sub>2</sub></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, find the largest power of two that’s less than or equal to
the number. In this case, 16 fits the bill because 32 is too large.
Subtract that value from the number, leaving 7 in this case. Then repeat
the process. The last step is to collect the coefficients of the powers
of two into a sequence to get the binary equivalent. We used 16, 4, 2,
and 1 but skipped 8. If we write a 1 for every place we used and a 0 for
every place we skipped, we get 23 = 10111<sub>2</sub>. While this is a
straightforward procedure for decimal to binary conversion, it can be
cumbersome for larger numbers.</p>

<p>An alternate way to convert a decimal numeral to an equivalent binary
numeral is to divide the given number by 2 until the quotient is 0
(keeping only the integer part of the quotient). At each step, record
the remainder found when dividing by 2. Collect these remainders (which
will always be either 0 or 1) to form the binary equivalent. The least
significant bit is the remainder obtained after the first division, and
the most significant bit is the remainder obtained after the last
division.  In other words, this approach finds the digits of the binary number in backward order.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In mathematics, binary numerals can represent arbitrarily big numbers.
Inside of a computer, the size of a number is constrained by the number
of bits used to represent it. For general purpose computation, 32- and
64-bit integers are commonly used. The largest integer that
Java represents with 32 bits is 2,147,483,647, which is good enough for
most tasks. For larger numbers, Java can represent up to
9,223,372,036,854,775,807 with 64 bits. Java also provides
representations for integers using 8 and 16 bits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These representations are easy to determine for positive numbers: Find
the binary equivalent of the number and then pad the left side with
zeroes to fill the remaining space. For example,
19 = 10011<sub>2</sub>. If stored using 8 bits, 19 would be
represented as <code>0001 0011</code>. If stored using 16 bits, 19 would be
represented as <code>0000 0000 0001 0011</code>. (We separate groups of 4 bits for
easier reading.)</p>

<h5 id="_negative_integers_in_a_computer">Negative integers in a computer</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Negative integers are also represented in computer memory as binary
numbers, using a system called <em>two’s complement</em>. When looking at the
binary representation of a signed integer in a computer, the leftmost
(most significant) bit will be 1 if the number’s negative and 0 if
it’s positive. Unfortunately, there’s more to finding the representation
of a negative number than flipping this bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose that we need to find the binary equivalent of the decimal number
-12 using 8 bits in two’s complement form. The first step
is to convert 12 to its 8-bit binary equivalent. Doing so we get 12 =
<code>0000 1100</code>. Note that the leftmost bit of the representation is a 0,
indicating that the number is positive. Next, we take the two’s
complement of the 8-bit representation in two steps. In the first step,
we flip every bit, i.e., change every 0 to 1 and every 1 to 0. This
gives us the <em>one’s complement</em> of the number, <code>1111 0011</code>. In the
second step, we add 1 to the one’s complement to get the two’s
complement. The result is <code>1111 0011</code> + <code>1</code> = <code>1111 0100</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, the 8-bit, two’s complement binary equivalent of -12 is
<code>1111 0100</code>. Note that the leftmost bit is a 1, indicating that this is
a negative number.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next we obtain the one’s complement of the binary representation by
flipping 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s. This gives us <code>1110 0010</code>. Finally, we

negative number. Therefore, we reverse the process of making a two’s
complement. First, we subtract 1 from the representation, yielding
<code>1000 1100</code> - <code>1</code> = <code>1000 1011</code>. Next, we flip all the bits in this
one’s complement form, yielding <code>0111 0100</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We convert this binary representation to its decimal equivalent,

<p>Why do computers use two’s complement? First of all, they need a system that
can represent both positive and negative numbers. They could have
used the leftmost bit as a sign bit and represented the rest of the
number as a positive binary number. Doing so would require a check on
the bit and some conversion for negative numbers every time a computer
wanted to perform an addition or subtraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of the way it’s designed, positive and negative integers stored
in two’s complement can be added or subtracted <strong>without</strong> any special
conversions. The leftmost bit is added or subtracted just like any other
bit, and values that carry past the leftmost bit are ignored. Two’s
complement has an advantage over one’s complement in that there is only
one representation for zero. The next example shows two’s complement in
action.</p>

right, padding with whatever the sign bit is. If you do a signed right
shift by <em>n</em> positions, it’s equivalent to dividing the
number by 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> (with integer division). The unsigned right
shift moves the bits to the right, including the sign bit, filling the

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Floating-point representation</em> is a system used to represent rational numbers
in computer memory. In this notation a number is represented as
<em>a</em> × <em>b</em><sup><em>e</em></sup>, where <em>a</em> gives the
<em>significant digits</em> (mantissa) of the number and <em>e</em> is the
exponent. The system is very similar to scientific notation, but
computers usually use base <em>b</em> = 2 instead of
10.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, we could write the binary number 1010.1<sub>2</sub> in floating-point
representation as 10.101<sub>2</sub> × 2<sup>2</sup> or as
101.01<sub>2</sub> × 2<sup>1</sup>. In any case, this number is equivalent to
10.5 in decimal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In standardized floating-point representation, <em>a</em> is written so
that only the most significant non-zero digit is to the left of the
decimal point. Most computers use the IEEE 754 floating-point representation
to represent rational numbers. In this notation, the memory to store the
number is divided into three segments: one bit used to mark the sign of
the number, <em>m</em> bits to represent the mantissa (also known
as the <em>significand</em>), and <em>e</em> bits to represent the
exponent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In IEEE floating-point representation, numbers are commonly represented using
32 bits (known as <em>single precision</em>) or using 64 bits (known as <em>double
precision</em>). In single precision, <em>m</em> = 23 and
<em>e</em> = 8. In double precision, <em>m</em> = 52 and
<em>e</em> = 11. To represent positive and negative exponents, the
exponent has a <em>bias</em> added to it so that the result is never negative.
This bias is 127 for single precision and 1,023 for double precision.
The packing of the sign bit, the exponent, and the mantissa is shown in
<a href="index.html#numberRepresentationFigure">Figure 1.4</a> (a) and (b).</p>

<li>
<p>Convert 10.5 to its binary equivalent using methods described

of integers, the sign of the number is taken care of separately for
floating-point. Thus, we would use 1010.1<sub>2</sub> for
-10.5 as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write this binary number in standardized floating-point representation,
yielding 1.0101<sub>2</sub> × 2<sup>3</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the leading bit (always a 1 for non-zero numbers), leaving <code>0101</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pad the fraction with zeroes on the right to fill the 23-bit
mantissa, yielding <code>0101 0000 0000 0000 0000 000</code>. Note that the decimal
point is ignored in this step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add 127 to the exponent. This gives us an exponent of
3 + 127 = 130.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convert the exponent to its 8-bit unsigned binary equivalent. Doing
so gives us 130<sub>10</sub> = 10000010<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the sign bit to 0 if the number is positive and to 1 otherwise.
Since 10.5 is positive, we set the sign bit to 0.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fixing the number of bits used for representing a real number limits the
numbers that can be represented in computer memory using the floating-point
notation. The largest rational number that can be represented in
single precision has an exponent of 127 (254 after bias) with a mantissa
consisting of all 1s:<br>
<code>0 1111 1110 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 111</code><br>
This number is approximately 3.402 × 10<sup>38</sup>. To
represent the smallest (closest to zero) non-zero number, we need to
examine one more complication in the IEEE format. An exponent of 0
implies that the number is unnormalized. In this case, we no longer
assume that there is a 1 bit to the left of the mantissa. Thus, the
smallest non-zero single precision number has its exponent set to 0 and
its mantissa set to all zeros with a 1 in its
23<sup>rd</sup> bit:<br>
<code>0 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 001</code><br>
Unnormalized single precision values are considered to have an exponent
of -126. Thus, the value of this number is
2<sup>-23</sup> × 2<sup>-126</sup> =
2<sup>-149</sup> ≈ 1.4 × 10<sup>-45</sup>. Now that we know the rules for
storing both integers and floating-point numbers, we can list the
largest and smallest values possible in 32- and 64-bit representations
in Java in the following table. Note that <strong>largest</strong> means the
largest positive number for both integers and floating-point values, but
<strong>smallest</strong> means the most negative number for integers and the smallest
positive non-zero value for floating-point values.<br></p>

<p>When the exponent and the mantissa are both 0, the number is
interpreted as a 0.0 or -0.0 depending on the sign bit. For example,
in a Java program, dividing 0.0 by -1.0 results in -0.0. Similarly,
-0.0 divided by -1.0 is 0.0. Positive and negative zeroes only exist
for floating-point values. -0 is the same as 0 for integers. Dividing
the integer 0 by -1 in Java results in 0 and not in -0.</p>

<p>An overflow or an underflow might occur while performing arithmetic on
floating-point values. In the case of an overflow, the resulting
number is a special value that Java recognizes as infinity. In the
case of an underflow, it is a special negative infinity value. For
example, dividing 1.0 by 0.0 in Java results in infinity and dividing
-1.0 by 0.0 results in negative infinity. These values have well
defined behavior. For example, adding 1.0 to infinity yields infinity.<br>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>After all the discussion of the hardware, software, and data
representation inside of a computer, you might feel more confused about
which computer to buy than before. As a programmer, it’s important to
understand how data is represented, but this information plays virtually
no role in deciding which computer to buy. Unlike most problems in this

development of technology progresses so rapidly, any advice about

Putting marketing biases aside, the three operating systems have become

<p>Once you’ve decided on an OS, you can pick hardware and other software
that’s compatible with it. For macOS, almost all your hardware choices
will be computers sold by Apple. For Windows and Linux, you can either
have a computer built for you or build your own. Although computer
hardware changes quickly, let’s examine some general guidelines.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">CPU</dt>
<dd>
<p>Remember that the speed of a CPU is measured in GHz (billions of clock
cycles per second). Higher GHz is generally better, but it’s hard to
compare performance across different designs of CPU. There’s also a
diminishing returns effect: The very fastest, very newest CPUs are
often considerably more expensive even if they only provide slightly
better performance. It’s usually more cost effective to select a CPU
in the middle of the performance spectrum.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cache size also has a huge effect on performance. The larger the
cache, the less often the CPU has to read data from slower
memory. Since most new CPUs available today are 64-bit, the question
of word size is no longer significant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although some specialists may prefer one or the other, both Intel and
AMD make powerful, competitive consumer CPUs.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Memory</dt>
<dd>
<p>Memory includes RAM, hard drives, optical drives, and any other
storage. RAM is usually easy to upgrade for desktop machines and less
easy (though often possible) for laptops. The price of RAM per
gigabyte goes down over time. It may be reasonable to start with a
modest amount of RAM and then upgrade after a year or two when it
becomes cheaper to do so. It takes a little bit of research to get
exactly the right kind of RAM for your CPU and motherboard. The amount
of RAM is dependent on what you want to do with your system. The
minimum amount of RAM to run Microsoft Windows 10 is 1 GB for 32-bit
versions and 2 GB for 64-bit versions. The minimum amount of RAM to
run Apple macOS Mojave is 2 GB. One rule of thumb is to have
at least twice the minimum required RAM.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hard drive space is dependent on how you expect to use your
computer. 1 TB and 2 TB drives are not very expensive, and either
represents a huge amount of storage. Only if you plan to have enormous
libraries of video or uncompressed audio data will you likely need
more. Corporate level databases and web servers and some other
business systems can also require vast amounts of space. Hard drive
speed is greatly affected by the hard drive’s cache size. As always, a
bigger cache means better performance. Using a solid state drive (SSD)
instead of a traditional hard drive has much better performance but
higher cost per megabyte. If you can afford an SSD, this single upgrade
is likely to <em>feel</em> like the greatest increase in overall computer speed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Installing optical drives and other storage devices depends on
individual needs. With the rise of streaming services and cloud backup,
optical drives have become less popular.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">I/O Devices</dt>
<dd>
<p>The subject of I/O devices is personal. It’s difficult to say
what anyone should buy without considering his or her specific needs.
A monitor is the essential visual output device while a keyboard and
mouse are the essential input devices. Speakers are important as
well. Most laptops have all of these elements integrated in some form or
another. Laptops often have inexpensive web cameras installed as well.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Someone interested in video games might want to invest in a powerful
graphics card. Newer cards with more video RAM are generally better
than older cards with less, but which card is best at a given price
point is the subject of continual discussion at sites like
<a href="http://www.anandtech.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AnandTech</a> and
<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom’s Hardware</a>.</p>

<h4 id="_concurrency_multicore_processors">1.4.1. Concurrency: Multicore processors</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the last decade, the word “core” has been splattered all over CPU
packaging. Intel in particular has marketed the idea heavily with its
older Core and Core 2 models and its modern Core i3, Core i5, Core i7,
and Core i9 chips. What are all these cores?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looking back into the past, most consumer processors had a single
<em>core</em>, or brain. They could only execute one instruction at a time.
Even this definition is hazy, because pipelining kept more
than one instruction in the process of being executed, but overall
execution proceeded sequentially.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The advent of multicore processors has changed this design
significantly. Each processor has several independent cores, each of
which can execute different instructions at the same time. Before the
arrival of multicore processors, a few desktop computers and many
supercomputers had multiple separate processors that could achieve a
similar effect. However, since multicore processors have more than one
effective processor on the same silicon die, the communication time
between processors is much faster and the overall cost of a
multi-processor system is cheaper.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_good">The Good</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multicore systems have impressive performance. The first multicore
processors had two cores, but current designs have four, six, eight,
or higher. A processor with eight cores can
execute eight different programs at the same time. Or, when faced with a
computationally intense problem like matrix math, code breaking, or
scientific simulation, a processor with eight cores could solve the
problem eight times as fast. A desktop processor with 100 cores that can
solve a problem 100 times faster is not out of reach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, modern graphics cards are already blazing this trail. Consider
the 1080p standard for high definition video, which has a resolution of
1,920 × 1,080 <em>pixels</em>. Each pixel (short for <em>picture element</em>) is a dot on the screen.
A screen whose resolution is 1080p has
2,073,600 dots. To maintain the illusion of smooth movement, these dots
should be updated around 30 times per second. Computing the color for
more than 2 million dots based on 3D geometry, lighting, and physics
effects 30 times a second is no easy feat. Some of the cards used to
render computer games have hundreds or thousands of cores. These cores
are not general purpose or completely independent. Instead, they’re
specialized to do certain kinds of matrix transformations and
floating-point computations.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_bad">The Bad</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although chip-makers have spent a lot of money marketing multicore
technology, they haven’t spent much money explaining that one of the
driving forces behind the “multicore revolution” is a simple failure
to make processors faster in other ways. In 1965, Gordon Moore, one of
the founders of Intel, remarked that the density of silicon
microprocessors had been doubling every year (though he later revised
this to every two years), meaning that twice as many transistors
(computational building blocks) could fit in the same physical space.
This trend, often called Moore’s Law, has held up reasonably well. For
years, clever designs relying on shorter communication times,
pipelining, and other schemes succeeded in doubling the effective
performance of processors every two years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At some point, the tricks became less effective and exponential gains in
processor clock rate could no longer be sustained. As clock frequency
increases, the signal becomes more chaotic, and it becomes more
difficult to tell the difference between the voltages that represent 0s
and 1s. Another problem is heat. The energy that a processor uses is
related to the <strong>square</strong> of the clock rate. This relationship means that
increasing the clock rate of a processor by a factor of 4 will increase
its energy consumption (and heat generation) by a factor of 16.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The legacy of Moore’s Law lives on. We’re still able to fit more and
more transistors into tinier and tinier spaces. After decades of
increasing clock rate, chip-makers began using the additional silicon
density to make processors with more than one core instead. Since 2005
or so, increases in clock rate have stagnated.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_ugly">The Ugly</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Does a processor with eight cores solve problems eight times as fast as
its single core equivalent? Unfortunately, the answer is, “Almost
never.” Most problems are not easy to break into eight independent
pieces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if you want to build eight houses and you have eight
construction teams, then you probably can get pretty close to completing
all eight houses in the time it would have taken for one team to build a
single house. But what if you have eight teams and only one house to
build? You might be able to finish the house a little early, but some
steps necessarily come after others: The concrete foundation must be
poured and solid before framing can begin. Framing must be finished
before the roof can be put on. And so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like building a house, most problems you can solve on a computer are
difficult to break into concurrent tasks. A few problems are like
painting a house and can be completed much faster with lots of
concurrent workers. Other tasks simply cannot be done faster with more
than one team on the job. Worse, some jobs can actually interfere with
each other. If a team is trying to frame the walls while another team is
trying to put the roof onto unfinished walls, neither will succeed, the
house might be ruined, and people could get hurt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On a desktop computer, individual cores generally have their own level 1
cache but share level 2 cache and RAM. If the programmer isn’t careful,
he or she can give instructions to the cores that will make them fight
with each other, overwriting memory that other cores are using and
crashing the program or giving an incorrect answer. Imagine
if different parts of your brain were completely independent and fought
with one another. The words that came out of your mouth might be gibberish.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To recap, the first problem with concurrent programming is finding ways
to break down problems so that they can be solved faster with multiple
cores. The second problem is making sure that the different cores
cooperate so that the answer is correct and makes sense. These are not
easy problems, and many researchers are still working on finding better
ways to do both.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some educators believe that beginners will be confused by concurrency
and should wait until later courses to confront these problems. We
disagree: Forewarned is forearmed. Concurrency is an integral part of
modern computation, and the earlier you get introduced to it, the more
familiar it’ll be.</p>

<p>Then, we introduced the topic of how numbers are represented inside the

another were explained. We discussed how floating-point representation is used
to represent rational numbers. A sound knowledge of data representation
helps a programmer decide what kind of data to use (integer or
floating-point and how much precision) as well as what kind of errors to expect
(overflow, underflow, and floating-point precision errors).</p>

<p>The IEEE 754 standard also defines a 16-bit (half) precision format. In
this format there is one sign bit, five bits for the exponent, and ten
bits for the mantissa. This format is the same as single and double
precision in that it assumes that a bit with a value of 1 precedes the
ten bits in the mantissa. It also uses a bias of 15 for the exponent.
What’s the largest decimal number that can be stored in this format?</p>
